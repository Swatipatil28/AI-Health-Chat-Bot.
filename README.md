# HealthAssist: AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot

**HealthAssist** is a healthcare assistant chatbot built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **AI** technologies. This project leverages the power of the Hugging Face `transformers` library and the GPT-2 model to help users receive health-related advice and assistance in a conversational format. 

Whether you’re looking for symptom analysis, medication reminders, or even help scheduling appointments, **HealthAssist** aims to offer a simple, intuitive, and reliable chatbot experience for health-related inquiries.

## Features

- **AI-powered conversation**: Powered by GPT-2, **HealthAssist** generates responses to healthcare-related queries.
- **Symptom-related guidance**: Get advice on symptoms you may be experiencing.
- **Medication reminders**: Receive reminders to take prescribed medications.
- **Appointment assistance**: Helps users schedule doctor appointments.
- **Text-based interface**: Use the chatbot directly in your browser with a user-friendly input box.

## Installation

To run this chatbot locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthassist.git
cd healthassist
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the environment:
- **Windows (CMD)**:
  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```bash
  .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also install them individually if preferred:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers nltk
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

To run the chatbot, simply execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a Streamlit interface in your browser. You can interact with the chatbot directly.

## Usage

Once the app is running, the interface will allow you to input questions or health-related queries. The chatbot will respond with relevant health information, symptoms guidance, and other helpful advice.

Examples of questions you can ask:

- "What should I do if I have a headache?"
- "Can you remind me to take my medication?"
- "Help me schedule an appointment with a doctor."

## How It Works

- **Text Processing**: The input text is processed using NLTK for tokenization and stopword removal.
- **GPT-2 Model**: The chatbot uses the Hugging Face `distilgpt2` model to generate responses. This model was fine-tuned to generate conversational replies to healthcare-related queries.
- **Response Generation**: Depending on the user's query, the chatbot either provides a predefined response (e.g., about medication or symptoms) or uses GPT-2 to generate a detailed reply.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to improve the project, feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request. Contributions could include:

- Fixing bugs
- Enhancing existing features
- Adding new healthcare features
- Improving the model or fine-tuning for better responses
